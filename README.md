## FTP-implicit-ssl-tls PHP client
Simple class for cURL functions to transfer an ASCII file over FTP with implicit SSL/TLS<br />

## My contribute...
I added some new functions to obtain a **working FTPS client** with almost all useful/needed function by most developers. This class works perfectly with **Aruba DocFly** service, to automate files upload by FTP. On 2019-01-01 the italian burocracy introduced the obligation to archive invoices to digitally signed supports, hosted by certified companies.
Some "throw new Exception" were removed, in favour of boolean value return.<br />
