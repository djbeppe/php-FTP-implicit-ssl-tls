# php-FTP-implicit-ssl-tls
Simple class for cURL functions to transfer an ASCII file over FTP with implicit SSL/TLS
Forked from: https://github.com/nalindaDJ/php-FTP-implicit-ssl-tls/blob/master/class-ftp-implicit-ssl-tls.php

## My contribute...
In addition to initial release, I added some new functions to obtain a full working FTPS client.
Some "throw new Exception" were removed, in favour of boolean value return.
