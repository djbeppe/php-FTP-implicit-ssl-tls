# FTP-implicit-ssl-tls PHP client
Simple class for cURL functions to transfer an ASCII file over FTP with implicit SSL/TLS<br />

## My contribute...
I added some new functions to obtain a **working FTPS client** with almost all useful/needed function.<br />
Some "throw new Exception" were removed, in favour of boolean value return.<br />
<br />
